# k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Machine Learning Assignment

This repository contains the implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm for a Machine Learning assignment. The project demonstrates the application of kNN for classification tasks using the Iris dataset, a popular dataset in the ML community.

## Overview

k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) is a simple yet powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The algorithm is based on the principle that "closer neighbors have more influence."

In this project, we:

1. Explored the Iris dataset, including features and target labels.
2. Visualized the data to understand feature distributions.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
4. Built and trained a kNN classifier.
5. Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Features of This Repository

- **Data Exploration**:
  - Loaded and visualized the Iris dataset.
  - Conducted feature-wise scatter plots to understand class separation.

- **Model Implementation**:
  - Trained a kNN model using scikit-learn's `KNeighborsClassifier`.
  - Tuned hyperparameters like the number of neighbors (`k`) to optimize performance.

- **Evaluation**:
  - Assessed the model's accuracy on unseen data.
  - Analyzed confusion matrices and classification reports for deeper insights into performance.

## Results

The kNN model achieved high accuracy on the Iris dataset, showcasing its effectiveness for this problem. However, the model's performance is sensitive to the choice of `k`, as well as the distribution of data.

The confusion matrix and classification report revealed that:
- The model performs well with clearly separable classes.
- Misclassifications occur in cases where class overlap is significant.
